# PyBer Analysis

## Overview of the analysis: 

We created this project for the company Pyber to analyze rideshare data by city. We analyze the data by breaking it down to 3 city types: Urban, Suburban & Rural.
We also added the Total rides, total drivers, average ride fare & average fare per driver. This analysis will help the company to identify the difference in different cities and make better strategic decision.

## Results:

To begin the analysis, we broken down the city in 3 different types: Rural, Suburban, and Urban. 
After adding total rides, total drivers, average ride fare & average fare per driver

The Urban city has the highest revenue because of the largest number of drivers and rides but it has the lowest average fare per ride & per driver.
The Rural city type has the highest average fare per ride & per ride.

## Summary:

The weekly data is very helpful and looking at some of the week there are highest rates for all city types, it will be good to have more information for the highest week to know if there was an event which affected the rides. It will be a helpful information for the next year to make better business decisions.

Looking at the data it would be good to add drivers in rural cities, this will provide accessibility which will increase the revenue.
